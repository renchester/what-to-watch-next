### Notes

This project served as my first every Typescript project, as well as a way to further explore web accessibility, API calling, and also the features of React Router and Vitest/React Testing Library.

### To-do

1. A section to show where the current movies are being played/shown/streamed.

2. Possibility to include TV shows as well, but would require a huge undertaking.
